 * \brief This module is designed to export PolyData build upon vertical lines
 * that was created by vtkGRASSMulti(Raster|Vector)PolyDataLineReader as
 * GRASS raster maps using the current region settings.

 * As input a PolyData set is expected. The name of a single
 * array, the layer number and the resulting raster map name must be provided.
 *
 * Only a single array and a single layer can be exported as raster map.
