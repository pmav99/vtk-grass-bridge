 * \brief This class provides read and write access to vector map database tables in grass
 *
 * Objects of this class and subclasses will only be created by subclasses of vtkGRASSVectorMapBase
 * to ensure that database tables are always related to vector maps
 *
 * This class provides methods to open and close the database connection of
 * grass vector maps as well as functions to create tables,
 * to select single values or an array of values
 * from a table column. The selection can be modified using where statements.
