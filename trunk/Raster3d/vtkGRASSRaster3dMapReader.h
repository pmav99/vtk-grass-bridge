/**
 * \brief This class provides an interface to the raster3d map io library to
 * read a raster3d map.
 *
 * The user can choose the current region, the default region, the raster map region or
 * a user defined region to open the raster3d map.
 *
 * This class does not use the vtk update mechanism.
 * Before reading the raster3d map values you need to open the raster3d map.
 * After reading you must close the raster3d map or delete the object. The
 * destructor will close the map.
