/**
 * \brief This class provides an interface to the raster map io library to
 * write a raster map row by row.
 *
 * The user can choose the current region, the default region, the raster map region or
 * a user defined region to open the new raster map.
 *
 * This class does not use the vtk update mechanism.
 * Before writing the new raster map rows you need to open the raster map.
 * After writing you must close the raster map or delete the object. The
 * destructor will close the map.
 * 
 * The user can provide a vtkGRASSHistory object, which will be used to write the history
 * of the map.
