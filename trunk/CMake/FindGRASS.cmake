# Find the native GRASS includes and library

# This module defines
# GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find gis.h, raster.h, vector.h ...
# GRASS_LIBRARY_DIR, where to find lib_gis, lib_raster  ...
# GRASS_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use GRASS.
# GRASS_FOUND, If false, do not try to use GRASS.
