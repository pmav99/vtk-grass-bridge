/**
 * \brief This class reads a grass vector map with topology support from a valid location/mapset
 * and creates a vtkPolyData output.
 *
 * Areas and isles are supported. Areas are representated as VTK_POLYGON and need to be triangulated
 * for pretty rendering. Additionally the categories, the type of an area (isle or not), the number of isles per
 * area and the size of an area are stored in cell data arrays.
 *
 * The can choose which feature typ should be created as output. Currently centroids, lines, points,
 * boundaries, areas and faces are supported. Only one feature type can be written to the output.
 * If you want to store different features in one poly data set, you need to create one reader for each feature type
 * and merge the output with the vtkAppendFilter.The points may be redundant.
 * Use a point merger to remove redundant points from the dataset.
 *
 * To use this class make sure you are in a grass session and vtkGRASSInit was called first.
 *
 *
 * This class uses the vtkGRASSVecctorMapTopoReader to read the vector map.
 *
 * \TODO Implement Database support to write the data from a database as cell data arrays.
 * \TODO Use vtkSmartPointer
