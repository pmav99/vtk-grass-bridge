/**
 * \brief This class reads multiple vector maps with feature types point or
 * centroid and creates a vtkPolyData dataset.
 *
 * The vector maps may represent the soil properties at different depths. Hence
 * they must be identical with the exception of the attribute table values.
 * The number of feature,the feature types, their location,
 * the categories and the column names must be identical.
 *
 * The z-coordinates of the points/centroids are ignored.
 *
 * The point/centroids of the input vector
 * maps will be  connected via lines in vertical direction.
 * The distance between the points must be provided as double array
 * and must be equal to the number of vector maps that are defined.
 *
 * The categorical data of the vector maps are assigned to the created lines,
 * hence each vector feature is represented as a vertical line and all vector
 * attributes are assigned to the line.
 *
 * In addition to the vector attribute column names that must be specified
 * alternative names can be provided. The vector column names are replaced
 * by the alternative names in the cell data arrays.
 * That is needed in case filter expect a static name for arrays to process.
