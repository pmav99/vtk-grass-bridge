/**
 * \brief This class writes vtkPolyData as grass vector map into a valid location/mapset.
 * It is specially designed to write nested, overlapping and non-convex areas as grass
 * vector data, so topology is consistent. 
 *
 * Two inputs are needed. The first input is vtkPolyData with vtkPolygons, 
 * vtkQuads or vtkTriangles which are converted into grass vector boundaries. The
 * centroids must be specified as the second input. They will be attached to the
 * boundaries and reference the cell data of the first input.
 * 
 * Areas and centroids are identififed by there category. 
 *
 * This class uses the vtkGRASSVecctorMapWriter to write the vector map.
